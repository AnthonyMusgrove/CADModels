# CADModels

As an engineer, I enjoy modelling 3D objects electronically.  I feel that sharing some of these models with the opensource community, it may help others with developing their projects quicker.

Most (if not all) of my models are created and assembled using Creo Parametric.

If you would like a model exported to STL or OBJ etc, please feel free to request using the Issues functionality.
